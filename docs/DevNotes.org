#+TITLE: Developer Notes
* System
These Vagrant images (OVM/OVS) are expected to be packaged together, and communicate over a private network (=intnet=). Furthermore the OVS servers expose multiple private networks. The list of devices networks and servers is given in the the table below:
| Server | Device | VirtualBox Adapter | Network    |
|--------+--------+--------------------+------------|
| OVM    | eth0   |                  1 | NAT        |
|        | eth1   |                  2 | INTNET     |
| OVS    | eth0   |                  1 | NAT        |
|        | eth1   |                  2 | INTNET     |
|        | ethN   |                N+1 | INTNET_N+1 |

Vagrant will modify the =ifcfg-ethN= files to a static address; Server rediscovery will (hopefully!) reset this networking back to whatever is configured for a specific set of machines.
* OVM
OVM is an application installed on top of Oracle Linux. Thus this isn't really part of a Packer build. I need to define a Vagrantfile to build this!

However OVM can be built silently using a response file.

For OVM 3.3 the response file format is online:   and here:
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
db:
	port : 49500         Sets the TCP port that MySQL uses
	user : ovs           Sets the username for the Oracle VM Manager database in MySQL
	password : p4ssword  Sets the password for the Oracle VM Manager database in MySQL

webLogic:
	user : weblogic      Sets the username for the Oracle WebLogic Server administrative user
	password : p4ssword  Sets the password for the Oracle WebLogic Server administrative user

OVMCore:
	user : admin         Sets the username for the Oracle VM Manager application
	password : p4ssword  Sets the password for the Oracle VM Manager application

Certificate:
       FQN : fully.qualified.domain.name  
                      Sets the value for the hostname applied to the
                      automatically generated self-signed SSL certificate that
                      Oracle VM Manager uses for HTTPS communications. It should
                      either match a valid IP address, or should contain the hostname
                      returned by the hostname -f command.             
#+END_SRC
My response file will be:
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
db:
	port : 49500         Sets the TCP port that MySQL uses
	user : ovs           Sets the username for the Oracle VM Manager database in MySQL
	password : Welcome1  Sets the password for the Oracle VM Manager database in MySQL

webLogic:
	user : weblogic      Sets the username for the Oracle WebLogic Server administrative user
	password : Welcome1  Sets the password for the Oracle WebLogic Server administrative user

OVMCore:
	user : admin         Sets the username for the Oracle VM Manager application
	password : Welcome1  Sets the password for the Oracle VM Manager application

Certificate:
       FQN : ovmm.lab.net
                      Sets the value for the hostname applied to the
                      automatically generated self-signed SSL certificate that
                      Oracle VM Manager uses for HTTPS communications. It should
                      either match a valid IP address, or should contain the hostname
                      returned by the hostname -f command.             

#+END_SRC
* OVS
OVS is a bare metal install using the Anaconda installer. Packer can handle this.

Unfortunately Packer installs the server successfully but after the server has rebooted Packer never completes the ssh connection (despite it being possible - I've done it in another terminal), and after the timeout Packer kills the build. I've filed this as an issue with Packer.
